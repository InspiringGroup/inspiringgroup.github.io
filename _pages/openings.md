We are looking for new Ph.D. students, Postdocs, Master students and undergraduate students to join our Group.
Collaborators are not limited to students who have enrolled in Tsinghua University.

### A letter to future members: 

<div class="largefont">
Pursuing a degree or solving scientific problems may require years of commitment. Thus, I truly believe that building a great working culture is the most important thing in our group, definitely more important than publications themselves. In fact, one of the secret sauces for Googleâ€™s decade-long success is its culture. 

At [InspiringGroup](.), we strive to build a unique working culture: 

* **Friendly:** treating every member with mutual respects is the minimal requirement. At InspiringGroup, we, including myself, are all friends. 

* **Supportive:** we are here to help and support each other. As a team, we will go through all ups and downs during the process.

* **Flourishing:** ultimately, I hope every group member will be flourishing, becoming not only academically successful, but also more mature and well-prepared as a person.
 
If you are willing to explore new things and work with a group of compassionate people (or you just want to learn how to apply for Top Universities and Companies aboard), feel free to shoot [[me]](./team) an email.
