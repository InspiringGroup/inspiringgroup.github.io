The [InspiringGroup](.) is a dynamic research group here @ [Tsinghua University INSC](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1181/1432.htm). We have worked on a wide range of topics centering around **data**. We build secure and efficient underlying systems infrastructure to support data communications. Meanwhile, we create various data-centric applications with special interests on data security and privacy. See our [Research](./research) for more details. 

The InspiringGroup is led by Principal Investigator (PI), [Dr. Zhuotao Liu](./team), who has a strong track-record in both academia and industry. Dr. Liu received his Ph.D. from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and worked at Google as a Technical Lead in both the NetInfra (Network Infrastructure) and GGN (Google Global Networking) team.
