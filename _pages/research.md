### Ongoing Research Projects

<br />

 <div class="rblock">
#### <b>Accountable and Trusted Large-scale ML/AI Algorithms and Systems

<div class="largefont">
 AI/ML is the most important data-driven application. In our team, we focus on solving some of the biggest open-problems in AI security and safety, including 
 
  * The certified robustness of various AI systems: we've worked on understanding the fundementals of AI safety and security in open-world and adversarial deployment. 
 
  * Data security and privacy in AI training, inference and model-service: we've worked on various techniques (such as privacy-preserving machine learning, federated learning, ZKP) to ensure data security and privacy in AI.

</div>
<br />

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Next-Generation Networking Infrastructures

<div class="largefont">

  * Intelligent Network DataPlane (INDP): Our team is the world leader in embracing the flexibility of programmable dataplane (e.g., programmable switches, SmartNICs, and host networking) to execute application-desired and data-driven traffic shaping/analysis logic, while imposing negligible overhead on the network data plane. 

  * Evolving the control-plane, data-plane, and management-plane for production-grade datacenter and WAN networks to enable various high-performance workloads, such as LLM training across large-scale data centers.

<br />
 

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Blockchain-Assisted Secur Infrastructures

<div class="largefont">
Blockchain is the fundamental infrastructure of the next-generation trust-based Web (the so-called Web3.0).  Web3.0 is often cited to shape every aspect of our lives:

  * Build transparent and trustworthy computing and ground-breaking Web3.0/Metaverse applications, such as transforming the legal sector via smart contract. 

  * Build security and trust systems to empower Internet architectural initiatives, such as verifiable routing and IP network.  
</div>
</div>
<br />

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Misc: InspiringGroup worked a wide range of other problems. 
 
<div class="largefont">
  * Privacy Computing:  we worked on various privacy computing techniques, including Federated Learning, Data Space, Secure Multi-party Computation, Secure Enclaves (i.e., trusted execution environments), Zero-knowledge Proofs, and Differential Privacy systems. 

  * AI-Driven Network Traffic Analysis: networking security heavily depends on the insights into encrypted traffic. Our team built various algorithms and systems to enable accurate analysis. 

  * Secure Inter-domain Routing: our team is leading in building a secure inter-domain routing protocol for the Internet.
