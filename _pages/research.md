## Research

<div class="largefont">
The InspiringGroup is working in all areas of systems and networking, with special interests in <span class="bluewords">next-generation infrastructures</span>, <span class="bluewords">security & privacy</span>, and <span class="bluewords">architectural disruptions</span>. We have published papers in top-tier venues and journals, covering *Internet Architecture, Blockchain Infrastructure, Datacenter Networking, Advanced Persistent Threat, Machine Learning Systems, etc*. See our [[Publications]](./publications) for more detail.

### Ongoing Research Projects

<div class="largefont">
Our current research is centering around the following theme: <span class="bluewords">Secure, Intelligent, and Practical Designs and Implementations for Large-Scale Distributed Systems</span>. The following are some concrete research directions.
</div>
<br />

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Next-Generation Networking Infrastructures

<div class="largefont">
The full stack of our technology is evolving drastically to empower various applications. Infrastructures with tightly-coupled network, storage and computing resources are the future. Due to its distributed nature, we face a unique combination of challenges and opportunities in Networking Infrastructure:

  * Embrace the flexibility of host networking to execute application-desired (and therefore highly specialized) traffic shaping logic, while imposing negligible overhead in network data-plane. 

  * Embrace the advance of network hardwares (i.e., programmable switches, SmartNICs) to achieve performant and low-latency cluster networking. 

  * Evolving the control-plane, data-plane, and management-plane for production-grade datacenter and WAN networks.

</div>
<br />

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Blockchain-Assisted Secure Infrastructures

<div class="largefont">
Blockchain is the fundamental infrastructure of the next-generation trust-based Web (the so-called Web3.0).  Web3.0 is often cited to shape every aspect of our lives:

  * Understand the defining trait of Web3.0 to separate the Web3.0 with the so-called Web2.0 era. 

  * Define and advance the fundamental infrastructure enablers for a trust-based future Internet/Web. 

  * Build transparent and trustworthy computing and ground-breaking Web3.0 applications via Blockchain Consortium. 

  * Build security and trust systems to empower new Internet architectural innovations and industry IoT systems. 
</div>
</div>
<br />

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Distributed Systems with Built-in (Artificial or Learned) Intelligence

<div class="largefont">
  * Intelligent distributed system designs powered by machine learning and data analysis, covering architectural design, management, performance, and deployment.

  * Data-driven security policy design for large-scale and heterogeneous systems. 

  * Systems to empower and secure Machine Learning innovations and applications. 

  * Machine learning security. 
</div>
</div>
<br />

<div class="rblock">
#### <b>Disruptive Initiatives to Shape Industry Battlegrounds 

<div class="largefont">
  * Root research proposals into societal problems such as data ownership and privacy invasion. 

  * Position research deliveries as industry market differentiators. 

  * Lead research initiatives that are visible and impactful to industry.
